    OperatorSamplingState

Sampling state for matrix-free/operator-based ARA compression.

This state implements the generic operator-input path used when the matrix is
available only through a linear operator `op` and its adjoint. The algorithm does
not form dense tiles. Instead, each tile sample is obtained by embedding a
tile-local test block into a global work buffer, applying the full operator, and
then extracting the tile-local output block.

For a tile `(i,j)` with global row support `I_i` and column support `J_j`, range
sampling computes

    Y_ij = A[I_i, J_j] * Ω

by performing

    Xwork[J_j, :] = Ω
    Xwork[not in J_j, :] = 0
    Ywork = op * Xwork
    Y_ij = Ywork[I_i, :]

Similarly, the corange/projection step computes

    V_ij = A[I_i, J_j]' * U_ij

by performing

    Ywork[I_i, :] = U_ij
    Ywork[not in I_i, :] = 0
    Xwork = adjoint(op) * Ywork
    V_ij = Xwork[J_j, :]

This is the generic, correctness-oriented matrix-free sampling path. It assumes
only that `op` supports multiplication by dense block work arrays and that
`adjoint(op)` is available for the corange step.

### Notes

The current implementation samples one active tile at a time using reusable
global work buffers. For each active tile, it zeros the global work buffer,
injects the local sample block into the tile column support, applies the full
operator, and slices out the tile row support. This avoids explicit dense tile
formation, but it may perform many full-operator applications.

A truly high-performance operator path would require a fused or batched sampling
routine that can inject multiple tile supports into one structured work buffer,
apply the operator once or a few times, and scatter/extract the corresponding
tile-local samples. Such fusion is operator-specific: for a generic black-box
`op`, the library cannot assume how to fuse multiple supported matvecs beyond
calling `mul!`. Efficient fused sampling therefore requires either:

  - a specialized `op` implementation that understands block-supported sampling,
  - a custom kernel for the specific matvec routine,
  - or an explicit backend hook that implements multi-support sampling directly.

Until such an operator-specific fused sampler is provided, this path should be
understood as the generic matrix-free ARA implementation, not necessarily the
optimal performance path.
